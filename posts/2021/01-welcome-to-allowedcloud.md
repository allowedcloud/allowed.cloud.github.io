A brief introduction of me and this website
<!-- Excerpt End -->

Hello, welcome to my website! Recently, I passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. While I've messed around with AWS for a couple of years, I've never had a job that fully involved it. By getting myself certified, I'm hoping to change that. Prior to the pandemic my job involved teaching children programming and STEAM concepts. At times we incorporated AWS into our lesson plans. For instance when teaching kids how to develop their own Alexa skill. We also taught our programming lessons in the Cloud9 IDE. This allowed students the ability to work on their code at home from their own devices.
