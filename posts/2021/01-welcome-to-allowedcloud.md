Hello world! A brief introduction of me and what's going on around here.
<!-- Excerpt End -->

Hello, welcome to my website! Recently, I passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam. While I've messed around with AWS for a couple of years, I've never had a job that fully involved it. By getting myself certified, I'm hoping to change that. Prior to the pandemic, my job involved teaching children programming and STEAM concepts. We used AWS for a variety of things, for instance our programming lessons were taught in the Cloud9 IDE. This allowed students the ability to work on their code at home from their own devices. We also did some classes teaching kids how to program their own Alexa skill. All of this is how I was first introduced and interacted with Amazon Web Services. It sparked my interest about the platform and what it could accomplish. A couple years later and a career transition onset by the pandemic and subsequent lock downs, I find myself in a place of wanting to work with the platform professionally and begin a career as a solutions architect.

Being at the beginning of my journey through AWS, I figured it'd be beneficial for me to document everything I learn. This will help me better retain and further my own understanding of the material. From my experience teaching I discovered that a great way to improve understanding of something is by teaching it to others. You don't even have to be necessarily teaching it to *others*, you can be teaching it back to yourself. I've gotten in the habit of writing myself a blog post of sorts anytime that I learn something. Writing in markdown gives you the ability to add code blocks. Sometimes these posts are simply a list of steps with added notes and code blocks. Other times they can involve more text and less code. Aside from the benefit from having to explain something in your own words, is the fact that it all makes great reference material.

My goal with this website is to help other people and help myself. I have a couple generic posts planned that I will have published in the coming weeks. I'm also planning on coming up with ten AWS related mini-projects that I can work on as a way to build a portfolio of sorts. All of these will be documented on this blog with all related code on Github. In addition to talking about AWS, I'll also talk about web app development. For the most part, my professional development experience is building front end applications. I've always been interested in security—of all kinds—and am excited to learn about cloud security. Linux has been my daily driver for almost a decade now but I've far from mastered much, will speak on my experience in an upcoming post.

This is only the very beginning. The plan is to grow this place for years to come. I'm always envious of professionals I see that have blogs dating back years. I think it's really cool and beneficial to everyone else who finds themselves on a similar journey. The cloud revolution is comfortably underway, which makes me excited to watch and document how things change over the next decade.
