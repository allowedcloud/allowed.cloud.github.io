I've recently passed the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam! While I've messed around with the platform for a couple of years, I've never had a job that fully involved it. By getting myself certified, I'm hoping to change that. Before the pandemic I was teaching kids STEAM concepts and at times we used AWS, for instance to build Alexa skills. We also would use Cloud9 to teach programming, which also gave the kids the ability to work on their code from home. Unfortunately when the pandemic and subsequent lock downs hit, I lost my job. But, being stuck at home the past year has given me time to organize and focus on refining some of my technical skills. One thing I learn from my experience teaching is that it's a great way to improve understanding. So, I figured that it'd be cool to start a blog detailing everything that I have learn throughout my journey. Not only will this help me improve my own understanding of things, but hopefully it'll be of benefit to others. Aside from AWS, I plan to also write about web app development, information security, and Unix.
